# React component that replicates GitHub's file list

This is a React Component that displays a list of files with their names, commit messages, and relative time they were modified. This is one of the components I made along my journey in learning React. This project covers all the basic concepts in React like one way data flow, props, state, etc.

## Running the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
    

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
